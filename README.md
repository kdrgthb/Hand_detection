# Hand Detection Project

This project aims to detect and analyze hand movements using computer vision techniques.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Mediapipe

### Installation

Step-by-step instructions to set up the project:

1. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe
    ```

2. Clone the project repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/hand_detection.git
    cd hand_detection
    ```

3. Run the main script to start hand detection:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

The project can be used to detect and track hand movements. Start the camera and observe the hand tracking in real-time.

```python
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
